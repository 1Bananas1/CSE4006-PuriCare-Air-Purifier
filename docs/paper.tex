\begin{abstract}
Air purifiers have become more and more common in people's houses, but as houses gain more technology, it seems that air purifiers haven't had any major improvements. We propose a smart air purifier which learns and adapts how it runs based on it's users. Specifically, by monitoring and recognizing when users are sick, gaining insights about air quality outside as well as seasonal allergies, and smart scheduling on when to run the air purifier to minimize electricity usage.
We are going to implement 3 models-cough detection, sniff detection, machine control. Respiratory diseases are air-sensitive, which means complicated factors, such as air quality-include dust, viruses, temperature, and humidity affect users. Our expanded goal is to implement total air care control.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
As the world continues to industrialize, air quality has declined as a direct consequence. As harmful particulate matter such as PM\textsubscript{2.5}, PM\textsubscript{10}, and other volatile organic matter enter the atmosphere, residents find difficulty in breathing under these conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO), estimates that 99\% of the global population breathes air that exceeds guidelines, leading to millions of premature deaths annually from various diseases \cite{b1}. 

Despite living in a technology-driven age, air purifiers have seemed to lack any significant advances, remaining more reactive than proactive. Modern air purifiers activate only once particles have been detected in the air, leaving users exposed to a harmful environment until the device responds. While this reactive approach provides some benefit, the delay between exposure and activation can lead to numerous audible health symptoms, such as sneezing or coughing, potentially interrupting important moments such as presentations or meeting. Furthermore, current air purifiers require human configuration and continue to run continuously regardless if anyone is home resulting in a waste of electricity.

We propose PureCare, a truly intelligent air purification system that acts as a proactive health assistant rather than a passive appliance. PureCare distinguishes itself through several key innovations: Audible Health Symptom Recognition technology that detects sneezing, coughing, and snoring to automatically adjust purification settings; geofencing capabilities that optimize operation based on occupancy; API integration with local air quality data to prepare for poor outdoor conditions; personalized care recommendations that learn individual sensitivities over time; and sleep mode optimization for nighttime respiratory issues. Unlike traditional purifiers that simply filter air, PureCare anticipates needs, provides gentle human-like notifications, and creates safer environments before problems arise.
